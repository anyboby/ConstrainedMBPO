fix the installation process, 

building conda env from this repo doesn't work properly, currently you have to:

1. create mbpo conda env from original mbpo repo (ad described in their installation)
2. pip install egg viskit from original mbpo repo
3. pip install setup.py of constrained mbpo
4. install safety-gym seperately
5. install stable baselines seperately
6. I also recently had trouble with serializable (softlearning uses hartikainen's version, not PyPi which seemed to be missing in the req.txt)
	git clone https://github.com/hartikainen/serializable
	cd serializable
	pip install -e .
7. Numpy also raised an error, that was easy to fix: unisntall numpy until not existing and pip isntall numpy
8. GLFW error when rendering mujoco-py:
	add 
		export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libGLEW.so
	to bashrc (in ssh this still doesn't work)
