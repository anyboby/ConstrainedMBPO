fix the installation process, 

building conda env from this repo doesn't work properly, currently you have to:

1. create mbpo conda env from original mbpo repo (ad described in their installation)
2. pip install egg viskit from original mbpo repo
3. pip install setup.py of constrained mbpo
4. install safety-gym seperately
5. install stable baselines seperately
