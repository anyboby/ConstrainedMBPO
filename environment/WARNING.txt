fix the installation process, 

building conda env from this repo doesn't work properly, currently you have to:

1. create mbpo conda env from original mbpo repo (ad described in their installation)
2. pip install egg viskit from original mbpo repo
3. pip install setup.py of constrained mbpo: 
	cd ConstrainedMBPO
	pip install -e .
4. not sure why, but inside examples.utils.py isnert following (and replace old part):
    if allow_policy_list:
        parser.add_argument(
            '--policy',
            type=str,
            nargs='+',
            choices=('gaussian', ),
            default='gaussian')
    else:
        parser.add_argument(
            '--policy',
            type=str,
            choices=('gaussian', 'cpopolicy'),
            default='gaussian')
5. install safety-gym seperately
6. install stable baselines seperately
7. check tf install, try other version, e.g. pip install tensorflow==1.14
	possibly install tf probability 0.7.0 for gaussian policy compatibility:
	pip install tensorflow-probability==0.7.0
8. same as above for mujoco-py
9. I also recently had trouble with serializable (softlearning uses hartikainen's version, not PyPi which seemed to be missing in the req.txt)
	git clone https://github.com/hartikainen/serializable
	cd serializable
	pip install -e .
10. Numpy also raised an error, that was easy to fix: unisntall numpy until not existing and pip isntall numpy
11. GLFW error when rendering mujoco-py:
	add 
		export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libGLEW.so
	to bashrc (in ssh this still doesn't work)
